## Suggested audit questions

- What responsibilities make `artifact:README.md` highly connected, and should any be separated?
- What responsibilities make `artifact:config/settings.yaml` highly connected, and should any be separated?
- What responsibilities make `artifact:config/schema.json` highly connected, and should any be separated?
- What repository evidence can resolve `unresolved:str` (str)?
- What repository evidence can resolve `unresolved:ghcr.io/example/route-api:dev` (ghcr.io/example/route-api:dev)?
- What repository evidence can resolve `unresolved:/usr/local/bin/worker` (/usr/local/bin/worker)?
- Which of the graph's 26 low-confidence relations are justified by source evidence, and which should be corrected?
